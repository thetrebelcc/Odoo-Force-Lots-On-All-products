# Odoo-Force-Lots-On-All-products
The script can be used to force all of the products in your Odoo database to use lot codes. To use the script, you will need to have access to the Odoo server and be familiar with the Odoo API.


## Prerequisites
Before running the script, you will need to have Python and the xmlrpc library installed on your system.

You will also need to set up a connection to the Odoo server by specifying the URL, database name, and login credentials in the script.

## Running the Script
To run the script, execute the following command:

python script.py

Where script.py is the name of the file containing the script.

## Notes
It is important to note that this script is provided for illustrative purposes only and may not be suitable for use in a production environment. I recommend thoroughly testing any script that modifies a database before implementing it in a live system.
